== SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS ==

Compiling the toolchain, the kernel & the rootfs:
 * use Debian Linux based system; here is the list of the necessary packages:
    bash python
    libglib2.0-dev zlib1g-dev libexpat1-dev
    libncursesw5-dev libncurses5-dev
    gcc g++ make flex bison libtool automake gperf
    curl wget
    texinfo gawk gettext
    sudo

 * the toolchain by default will be installed in /opt/rzx50 directory,
so make sure you have write-enabled /opt/rzx50 directory for your build user (e.g. chmod 777 /opt) and 300 MB of disk space in /opt;

 * build process use ~/tmp/ to store temporary files, so check,
that you have free 3 GB of disk space there.

== BUILD: STEP BY STEP ==
To use the scripts first time you must get some archives (source files for
crosstool-ng, rootfs and applications). Use mk_src_dir.sh script to do it:

 ./mk_src_dir.sh

The script will create the src and packages-ro subdirectories.
Also mk_src_dir.sh will download all necessary files.
Now you can build software

 ./build-all.sh
